# Outline_of_Differential_Equations
Outline of differential equations. Similar to the popular book series with the same name. In chapters 01, 03, 04, and 05, Python is used for calculations and matplotlib for plotting. In subsequent chapters, Wolfram Alpha (and also Maxima) are used for calculations, and matplotlib for plotting. Versions in classic Jupyter notebook and PDF formats are available.  (The PDFs are viewable in-place.)

Note: If you try to go to a branch and get a 404 page, you're not doing it right. Press the Code tab, upper left, and navigate from there.
